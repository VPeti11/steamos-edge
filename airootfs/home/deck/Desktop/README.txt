Welcome to SteamOS Edge!
This OS is designed to be ready-to-game liveboot image (with extra packages). However if you want to you can install it to your HDD by opening the shell and running 'sudo edge-deploy'. If you want an experimental mutable system run 'sudo edge-deploy-exp'.
Have fun with SteamOS Edge!
